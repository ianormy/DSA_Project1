# Project 1 - Unscramble Computer Science Problems
Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree Project 1 - Unscramble Computer Science Problems.

## Overview
In this project, I've completed five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. I have used Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, I've performed run time analysis of my solution and determined its efficiency.
