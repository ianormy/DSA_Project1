This file contains an explanation of my run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) for each solution
I have produced.

For all the tasks, n denotes the number of calls recorded and m denotes the number of texts recorded.

Task0
=====
To obtain the information required and then to print it would take the following time in the worst-case:

You will go through all the calls once to load them - O(n), then through all the texts to load them - O(m)

Altogether that would become:

O(n + m)


Task1
=====
To obtain the information required and then to print it would take the following time in the worst-case:

You will go through all the calls once to load them, then once to find the unique numbers - O(2n) ~= O(n)
You will go through all the texts once to load them, then once to find the unique numbers - O(2m) ~= O(m)

Altogether that would become:

O(n + m)

Task2
=====
To obtain the information required and then to print it would take the following time in the worst-case:

You will go through all the calls once to load them, then once to find the maximum time - O(2n) ~= O(n)

Altogether that would become:

O(n)

Task3
=====
To obtain the information required and then to print it would take the following time in the worst-case:

Part A - you will go through all the calls once to load them, then once to find the unique numbers, then once to print
them out in a sorted list - O(3n)
Part B - You will go through all the calls once to find the percentage required - O(n)

Altogether that would become:

O(4n) ~= O(n)

Task4
=====
To obtain the information required and then to print it would take the following time in the worst-case:

You will go through all the calls once to load them, then once to find the unique numbers, then once to remove numbers
that receive calls - O(3n) ~= O(n)
You will go through all the texts once to load them, then once to remove all numbers that send or receive
texts - O(2m) ~= O(m)
Finally you will go through the remaining unique numbers to print them off - O(n)

Altogether that would become:

O(n + m)
